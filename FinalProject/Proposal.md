I plan on working on a team to create a simple pong. Two players will hit a ball back and forth.
Week 1: Find reference pictures and game rules.
Week 2: Code the simple inputs.
Week 3: Add collision detection.
Week 4: Program the algorithm to hit a ball back and forth.
Week 5(Stretch goal): Add audio/AI.
I will create a web-based application using THREE.js.
