I plan on working on a team to create a simon game. Different colored buttons flash and the player must press the buttons in order. 
After a set number of correct presses, all will flash and the player will win.
Week 1: Find reference pictures and game rules.
Week 2: Code the four colors onto the screen.
Week 3: Add user input/interactability.
Week 4: Program the algorithm to generate random color flashes that the player must press.
Week 5(Stretch goal): Add audio.
